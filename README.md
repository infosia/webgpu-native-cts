# webgpu-native-cts

A WebGPU Conformance Test Suite (CTS) written in **C++**, targeting the **WebGPU C API**
(`webgpu.h`) directly — no JavaScript engine, no language bindings.

> The *tests* are C++ that call the WebGPU **C** API. C++ is used because the upstream CTS is
> object-oriented, fluent, and closure-based; a C++ port maps to it almost 1:1, which is the
> whole point of a faithful port.

The goal is to port the upstream TypeScript [WebGPU CTS](https://github.com/gpuweb/cts)
as faithfully as practical, so that native WebGPU implementations can be checked for
conformance by linking a small native test binary instead of embedding a full JS runtime.

## Why

The canonical WebGPU CTS is written in TypeScript and runs in a browser or against native
implementations through a JS engine bound to native code:

- **wgpu** runs the CTS via Deno (`deno_webgpu` ops → `wgpu_core`).
- **Dawn** runs the CTS via Node.js NAPI bindings (`dawn_node` → `dawn::native`).

Both approaches require shipping and maintaining a JavaScript runtime and a binding layer.
This project takes a different path: the tests are written directly against the C API that
implementations such as [wgpu-native](https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native),
[yawgpu](https://github.com/infosia/yawgpu), and
[Dawn](https://dawn.googlesource.com/dawn) export, so the test binary links straight against
the implementation under test.

## Target implementations

Tests are written against the **canonical** `webgpu.h` from
[webgpu-native/webgpu-headers](https://github.com/webgpu-native/webgpu-headers), which all of the
target backends implement. The suite is **link-agnostic**: a build-time option (`CTS_BACKEND`)
selects which implementation to link against. The three initial targets:

- **wgpu-native** — mature Rust implementation; used as the harness bring-up reference.
- **yawgpu** ([github.com/infosia/yawgpu](https://github.com/infosia/yawgpu)) — a from-scratch
  Rust implementation of `webgpu.h` (Metal/Vulkan backends; vendor extensions in a companion
  `yawgpu.h`); the primary conformance subject this suite is built to validate.
- **Dawn** — the C++ reference implementation; added after the vertical slice.

Implementation-specific differences (native feature enums, instance-creation extras like
yawgpu's `YaWGPUInstanceBackendSelect`) are isolated behind a thin backend shim.

## Language

- The entire suite — tests and harness — is **C++20**.
- Tests call the WebGPU **C** API (`webgpu.h`) directly; they do not depend on any C++ wrapper
  for WebGPU itself.
- The harness is a **custom C++ framework that mirrors the upstream CTS framework 1:1**
  (`MakeTestGroup` / `g.test().desc().params().fn()`, fluent parameter builders —
  `combine`/`combineWithParams`/`filter`/`expand`/`beginSubcases` with per-case subcase expansion —
  lambda test bodies, `expectValidationError([&]{ ... }, shouldError)`, the `suite:file:test:params`
  query system, and a case/subcase tree). It is **not** built on GoogleTest, Catch2, doctest, or
  Criterion — those impose a test model that conflicts with the CTS case/subcase split and
  query-string identity. The harness's own logic (params expansion, query parsing, format tables,
  expectation matching) is checked by a small self-test binary, `cts_unittests`, with no third-party
  test framework.

The build directories (`build-*/`) are git-ignored. The canonical `webgpu.h` is **not** vendored —
each backend supplies its own `webgpu-headers/webgpu.h` (Dawn its generated header), selected by
`CTS_BACKEND` at configure time.

## Status

**Active — the harness runs and is porting tests across all three backends on real hardware
(Apple Metal).** What works today:

- A complete custom harness: registry, fluent params (`combine`/`combineWithParams`/`filter`/`expand`
  with per-case subcase expansion), the `suite:file:test:params` query system, fixtures, error scopes,
  async→sync helpers, a listing generator, and `cts_unittests` self-tests.
- **Per-case crash isolation** (`--isolate` forks a subprocess per case, so a backend that *aborts*
  becomes a contained `crash` result instead of killing the run) and a **per-backend expectations**
  file (`--expectations`, with `:*` test-prefix lines) so a run with known divergences still exits 0.
- All three backends — **wgpu-native, yawgpu, Dawn** — build link-agnostically and run on a real GPU.
- Ported so far: 9 `api/validation` files, including a fully worked `createTexture` (16 tests with the
  uncompressed + compressed format-capability tables). See [COVERAGE](docs/COVERAGE.md).

**Conformance outcome.** The suite has surfaced 10 cross-backend findings (see [FINDINGS](docs/FINDINGS.md)).
Acting on them, **yawgpu — the primary conformance subject — now passes every ported `api,validation`
test on real-GPU Metal** (all of its findings F-005/006/008/009/010 were reported here, fixed upstream,
and confirmed resolved). Dawn passes everything; wgpu-native's eager-panic findings (F-001–F-004, F-007)
remain open. This is the suite working as intended: report a divergence → fix upstream → confirm on
hardware.
